# Exploring the Scale-Free Nature of Stock Markets: Hyperbolic Graph Learning for Algorithmic Trading

This codebase contains the python scripts for HyperStock-GAT, the model for the WWW 2021 paper [link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3450095).

## Environment & Installation Steps
Python 3.6, Pytorch, Pytorch-Geometric and networkx.


```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset and Preprocessing
